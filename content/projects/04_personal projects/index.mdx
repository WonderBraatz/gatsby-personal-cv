## Telegram Bot for Restaurant recommendations

Since I moved to Munich, I always got asked by friends who came to visit the city: _"Can you recommend any good Restaurants in town?"_
And I would always tell them about my top 5 restaurants at the time. But what if they didn't have to rely on my response or could even explore diffent types of restaurants that I know of and would recommend?

So my first idea was to create a database and build an API, so that all my favorite restaurants are accessible from everywhere and by all my friends.
But my friends might not be like me and don't like Databases and APIs... They want some friendly recommendations in an easy and convenient format!

Meet my Telegram Bot! It gives recommendations for differnt types of restaurants in a couple of cities and its responses were programmed by me, so it should always be nice to you.

## Minimalist Whiteboard WebApp

I needed a WhiteBoard App for my iPad and I wanted it to have infinite blank space...

So i created a very simple Application with just that: Black on white marker and an eraser. This project now serves as a quick note and appartment ToDo list.
