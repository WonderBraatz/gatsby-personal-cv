## About Me

Hi! Thank you for visiting my portfolio website.
I'm dedicated engineer and currently located in Munich, Germany.  
In 2021 I achieved my master of science degree in the topic of automotive engineering.  
My expertise ranges from vehicle design with CAD and ergonomics to process optimization and programming.  
I'm always open for a nice chat, so if you'd like to get in touch feel free to send a message via mail or LinkedIn.
Looking forward to exchanging experiences and getting to know each other!
Greetings from Germany ✌️
